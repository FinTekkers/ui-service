# Getting Started - Building

In order to build the protos in Javascript, you must download the web extension. For Mac this is:

brew install protobuf@3
brew link --overwrite protobuf@3

brew install protoc-gen-grpc-web

see more at https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web. Once install the Javascript portion of the compile.sh script at the root of this project should work.

TODO: Are there env variables required?

# Publishing

Please see the .github/workflows/npm-publish.yml for the workflow file that deploys the package to a private GitHub repository manager.

The workflow file creates a .npmrc file within the build step and injects the publish token into it. Currently this is coming from dado0583's account (need to migrate to org secrets). The ephemeral .npmrc file will look like this:

@USERNAME:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
